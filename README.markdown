# **4.17-ck1 kconfig** #

.config for sys-kernel/ck-sources (*gentoo*) which  
works adequately on my personal hardware. YMMV  
([*idiom / figure of speech*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/your_mileage_may_vary#Phrase) - **see also:** [license](LICENSE.markdown))

this particular kernel config by [kuzetsa](https://twitter.com/kuzetsa)  
may be used under the unlicense (*Public Domain*)  
... just do whatever. it's a config. (*I ain't yo mama*)

Based on a work at [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/)  
(*the linux kernel is licensed GPL. This is a config.*)
